# Hunter Smith's CS-499 Capstone e-Portfolio

## Introduction
Hello, my name is Hunter Smith, and welcome to my e-portfolio for my computer science capstone course at Southern New Hampshire University. This e-portfolio contains an artifact from a previous course I completed, a video code revied of the artifact, and enhancements to highlight all that I have learned during my time studying at SNHU and shows my strengths and skills in computer science in three categories. The categories being software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases. Each category enhancement also includes a written narrative that justifies its inclusion in this portfolio.  

## Professional Self-Assessment
When I began studying at SNHU, I knew nothing about computer programming, with my only knowledge of computers being things that I taught myself through YouTube videos and other online tutorials. During my time, I learned three different programming languages, software development life cycle, system analysis and design, software security, software testing, and more. I have learned and applied best security practices in my CS-305 cybersecurity course and in additional courses such as my CS-465 full stack development course and this capstone. Additionally, through my electives, I also learned about game design which is a personal hobby of mine. I also gained valuable non-technical skills, such as how to better collaborate in a team environment as well as how to communicate with stake holders regarding the technical side of what a computer scientist does. I have forged these skills through group projects such as my GAM-305 course where we worked in small teams to create a fully playable game or my CS-250 software development lifecycle and CS-255  system analysis and design courses where we learned the importance of engaging with stakeholders to define wants and needs for them, as well as highlighting the overall business requirements for a given project.

## Artifact
The goal of this capstone course was to select up to three artifacts from previous courses to enhance in three categories to showcase our skills in computer science. I selected a single artifact from one of the first courses in the program IT-145. IT-145 was an intro to Java and object-oriented programming. This artifact was a Java program to intake new pets into a pet-grooming business. The pet-grooming business had a set amount of space for dogs and cats and when intaking new pets needed to check to see if there was room before taking a new pet, getting some basic information, and calculating a check-out fee. I selected this artifact because I wanted to showcase all my growth after completing this introductory course.  In this capstone course, we performed a video code review of this artifact highlighting where the artifact is from, its purpose, and the planned enhancements in each category and how the enhancements align with the desired course outcomes for the capstone. 

You can find my code review [here](https://youtu.be/wUd5pwhC9YM) and the artifact's java file [here](https://github.com/hsmith1994/hsmith1994.github.io/blob/main/DogClass.java).

## Software design and engineering
For this category enhancement, I converted the Java artifact to Python. This conversion demonstrates my knowledge of both programming languages, an understanding of object-oriented programming practices, security best practices, and understanding the client’s needs and functionality of the program. My enhanced Python program not only achieves all the functionality of the original artifact but also expands upon it by including a menu for the client to interact with to intake new pets and calculate totals upon checkout.

You can find my enhanced python files [Pet Grooming](https://github.com/hsmith1994/hsmith1994.github.io/blob/main/PetGrooming.py) and [Pet Grooming Menu](https://github.com/hsmith1994/hsmith1994.github.io/blob/main/PetGroomingMenu.py).

My written narrative accompanying this enhancement which includes justification for the inclusion, the course outcomes this enhancement aligned with, and a reflection of my process enhancing the artifact can be found [here](/CS499Milestone2Smith.docx).

## Algorithm and data structure
For this category enhancement, I added a dictionary data structure and a sorting algorithm that previously did not exist in the artifact. I chose to implement a dictionary data structure because of how straight forward the approach to updating the capacity, checking for space, and adding and removing pets and how well this data structure works with the database I also had to implement. The artifact is improved by the addition of dictionary data structure, and I also included a sort menu for when the user wants to check the pets that are currently checked in.

## Databases
For this category enhancement, I added a database that was not present in the original artifact. I chose MongoDB for my database as I’ve used it in previous courses as well as PyMongo for implementing MongoDB in a python environment. I implemented authentication and authorization so that the data stored within my database is secured.
